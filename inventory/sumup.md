## PASSIVE RECON 2026-09-02 (read-only, non-intrusive)

> Recon observations only. These are NOT confirmed vulnerabilities; ownership/in-scope of each host must be confirmed against the program scope before any active testing. Hosts resolve + serve HTTP — investigation requires scoped authorization.

**Probed:** 9 hosts | **Live HTTP:** 5

> NOTE: repeated identical non-web port sets (e.g. 2082,2083,2086,2087,8080,8443) across many hosts and wide port sets are likely a shared edge/proxy answering EOF, NOT confirmed real services. Verify with a proper port scanner (e.g. nmap) under authorization before treating as real. These are surface-map hints only, not findings.
