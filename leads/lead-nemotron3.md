[NEW] Dedicated deep scan (2026-09-03) found **0 genuinely dedicated hosts** — all subdomains resolve to shared/CDN/wildcard IPs (Cloudflare, AWS ELB, iriscrm.com). Attack surface is wildcard-dominated; enumeration must focus on path/parameter-level on known hosts.
[NEW] `portal.sumup.com` CNAME → `sumup.iriscrm.com` (third-party CRM). This introduces supply-chain/SSRF surface via webhook/callback endpoints on a non-SumUp domain.
[CHANGED] `api.sumup.com` returns 404 on root — suggests versioned API paths (/v1, /v2, /beta, /internal) are the real surface, not yet mapped.

[HYP] API versioned endpoint IDOR/BOLA on merchant resources  
class: IDOR  
asset: api.sumup.com  
confidence: 65  
reasoning: Root returns 404; payment APIs typically version at /v1 /v2 /beta /internal. Merchant-scoped resources (transactions, payouts, devices, readers) often use predictable IDs (merchant_id, transaction_id, reader_serial). Cloudflare WAF may not block parameter tampering on authenticated calls.  
evidence_needed: Discovery of versioned API paths + authenticated requests showing cross-merchant access via ID manipulation  
verify_steps:  
testability: PASSIVE  
impact: Cross-merchant transaction/payout/device data access — HIGH (PCI/financial data)
[HYP] OAuth redirect_uri validation bypass on auth.sumup.com flows  
class: OAUTH  
asset: auth.sumup.com  
confidence: 55  
reasoning: auth.sumup.com redirects to /flows/login — indicates OAuth/OIDC authorization server. Common flaws: loose redirect_uri regex (subdomain bypass, path traversal), missing state validation, wildcard allowlist. Cloudflare fronting may mask origin validation logic.  
evidence_needed: Authorization endpoint accepting attacker-controlled redirect_uri with code leakage  
verify_steps:  
testability: PASSIVE  
impact: Authorization code theft → account takeover for merchants — CRITICAL
[HYP] SSRF via webhook/callback parameter on portal.sumup.com (iriscrm.com)  
class: SSRF  
asset: portal.sumup.com  
confidence: 45  
reasoning: CNAME to sumup.iriscrm.com (third-party CRM). Merchant portals often accept webhook_url/callback_url/return_url parameters for integrations. If validation is weak, SSRF to 169.254.169.254 (AWS metadata) or internal services is possible. Varnish caching layer may forward X-Forwarded-For/Host headers unsafely.  
evidence_needed: Parameter accepting URL that triggers outbound request to attacker-controlled or metadata endpoint  
verify_steps:  
testability: PASSIVE  
impact: Cloud metadata credential theft → lateral movement in SumUp AWS — CRITICAL
[PARKED] SSRF via webhook/callback parameter on portal.sumup.com: confidence 45 < threshold; third-party domain (iriscrm.com) ownership unconfirmed in-scope; verify_steps require form interaction (borderline active).  
[FINAL] 1. API versioned endpoint IDOR/BOLA on merchant resources (confidence 65)  
[FINAL] 2. OAuth redirect_uri validation bypass on auth.sumup.com flows (confidence 55)
[NEXT] PROBE: GET https://api.sumup.com/v1/ (HEAD) → observe status, Server header, WWW-Authenticate, rate-limit headers. If 404, repeat for /v2/, /beta/, /internal/, /swagger.json, /openapi.json, /api-docs.
[LEARN] ACCEPTED IDOR @ api.sumup.com: Versioned payment APIs are high-value; 404 on root is standard pattern — enumerate versions passively first.  
[LEARN] ACCEPTED OAUTH @ auth.sumup.com: /flows/login path confirms OAuth/OIDC flow; redirect_uri/state flaws are high-impact and testable passively via HEAD.  
[LEARN] REJECTED SSRF @ portal.sumup.com: Third-party CNAME (iriscrm.com) requires scope confirmation; webhook SSRF needs parameter discovery (active); parked until in-scope verified.
[RISK] sumup: 75 — Core payment API (api.sumup.com) and auth server (auth.sumup.com) are high-value targets with confirmed live HTTP, Cloudflare/AWS edge, and standard OAuth/API patterns that historically yield IDOR/OAuth flaws. Wildcard-dominated DNS limits subdomain enum but concentrates attack surface on known hosts. Third-party portal (iriscrm.com) adds supply-chain risk if in-scope.

[HYP] OAuth token_endpoint_auth_methods=none enables public client impersonation
class: AUTH
asset: auth.sumup.com
confidence: 70
reasoning: Both discovery docs list "none" in token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported — allows token endpoint calls without client authentication. Combined with PAR (pushed_authorization_request_endpoint) and request_object_signing_alg_values_supported including "none", a malicious client could register or reuse a public client_id and obtain tokens via PAR + token endpoint without client_secret.
evidence_needed: Successful token request to /oauth2/token with client_id only (no client_secret) using authorization_code from PAR flow
verify_steps: POST https://auth.sumup.com/oauth2/par with minimal request (client_id, redirect_uri, response_type=code, code_challenge) → observe if request_uri returned. Then POST https://auth.sumup.com/oauth2/token with grant_type=authorization_code, code=<from PAR>, client_id=<same>, no client_secret.
impact: Client impersonation → merchant account takeover via OAuth flow — CRITICAL
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[HYP] OAuth redirect_uri validation bypass via loose regex on auth.sumup.com
class: OAUTH
asset: auth.sumup.com
confidence: 60
reasoning: Discovery docs show redirect_uri registration required (require_request_uri_registration=true) but validation logic untested. Cloudflare fronts the auth server; common bypasses: subdomain takeover (evil.sumup.com), path traversal (/../), wildcard match (https://app.sumup.com.attacker.com), open redirect on registered domain. Scope catalog shows high-value merchant scopes.
evidence_needed: Authorization request to /oauth2/auth with attacker-controlled redirect_uri returning authorization code to attacker domain
verify_steps: GET https://auth.sumup.com/oauth2/auth?client_id=test&redirect_uri=https://evil.com&response_type=code&scope=merchants.read → observe redirect behavior. Test variants: https://sumup.com.evil.com, https://app.sumup.com/../evil.com, https://sub.sumup.com (if subdomain takeover possible).
impact: Authorization code theft → merchant account takeover — CRITICAL
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] API versioned endpoint IDOR/BOLA on merchant resources via authenticated calls
class: IDOR
asset: api.sumup.com
confidence: 55
reasoning: Auth discovery reveals complete merchant resource model (merchants/transactions/payouts/readers/checkouts/customers/api_keys/refunds/receipts/sales/roles + read/write). All unauthenticated paths 404. BOLA requires merchant OAuth token. x-envoy-decorator-operation leaks internal k8s routing (apigateway2-headless.identity.svc.cluster.local) — may indicate internal API structure.
evidence_needed: Authenticated cross-merchant access via ID manipulation (merchant_id, transaction_id, reader_serial) on versioned endpoints
verify_steps: Obtain valid merchant OAuth token (AUTH_HELPED). GET https://api.sumup.com/v1/merchants/{other_merchant_id}/transactions → observe 403 vs 200. Repeat for /v1/transactions/{txn_id}, /v1/readers/{serial}, /v1/payouts/{id}.
impact: Cross-merchant financial data access (transactions, payouts, readers) — HIGH (PCI/financial)
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[PARKED] Admin panel authentication bypass on admin.sumup.com: confidence 35 < 40; all header spoofing attempts return identical 403 with nginx/1.26.1 headers — no auth mechanism leak, no status change.

[FINAL] 2. OAuth redirect_uri validation bypass on auth.sumup.com (confidence 60)

[LEARN] ACCEPTED AUTH @ auth.sumup.com: token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported includes "none" — public client impersonation vector; requires live PAR+token flow test.
[LEARN] ACCEPTED OAUTH @ auth.sumup.com: Full discovery docs expose PAR, device flow, request_object alg "none", scope catalog mapping 1:1 to merchant API resources.
[LEARN] REJECTED MISCONFIG @ api.sumup.com: x-envoy-decorator-operation leaks apigateway2-headless.identity.svc.cluster.local — header/banner leak is explicit out-of-scope class.
[LEARN] ACCEPTED BUSLOGIC @ api.sumup.com: All versioned paths 404 unauthenticated; scope catalog from auth.sumup.com defines resource model but requires merchant token.
[LEARN] REJECTED AUTH @ admin.sumup.com: Header spoofing (Host, X-Forwarded-For, X-Original-URL) yields identical 403 — no auth bypass via passive header manipulation.
[RISK] sumup: 80 — Auth server (auth.sumup.com) exposes critical OAuth misconfigurations (token_endpoint_auth_methods=none, request_object alg=none, PAR, device flow) with full scope catalog mapping to payment API resources. API gateway (api.sumup.com) fully gated but resource model known. Admin panel hardened. Third-party portal adds supply-chain risk. High-value financial attack surface concentrated on known hosts.
